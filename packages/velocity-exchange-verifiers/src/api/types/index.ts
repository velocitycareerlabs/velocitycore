/**
 * @packageDocumentation
 * This module defines core types used in the Verifiable Credential (VC) verification framework
 * for the OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance (OpenID4VCI) protocol and the Velocity Profile.
 *
 * These types are used to implement a rule-based, composable verification pipeline for verifying
 * Credential JWTs, issuer metadata, and response objects. Each verifier produces structured
 * verification errors with traceable paths.
 *
 * @remarks
 * - `Verifier<T>` defines a reusable verification rule for a given type.
 * - `CredentialIssuerMetadata` describes issuer metadata retrieved during discovery.
 * - `VerificationContext` provides shared metadata and state for all verifiers.
 * - `VerificationError` captures a single verification rule failure.
 * - `CredentialJwt` represents a parsed JWT in the VC issuance flow.
